3 Aspects of Efficiency: 
- Time it takes to Write your Code 
- Time is takes to Run your Code 
- Amount of memory your code uses 

Tradeoffs among aspects: 
	improve running time of code by spending a lot of time writing it (only for code that is to be run many times in future)
	tradeoff between memory/running time: store more items in memory but uses more memory

R is designed to be easy to use (advantage for coding time efficiency but not run time efficiency)
	summary is different based on variable type (numeric,factor,character)
	slower than C as it does a lot of work behind the scenes. 

Outline: Strategies for improving Efficiency 
1) Avoid repetition (functions)
2) Vector calculations are better than for loops 
3) Use existing functions 
4) Plan ahead for memory use


Vector Calculation are BETTER than for loops
